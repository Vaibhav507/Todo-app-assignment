# To-Do List Application

This is a simple to-do list application built with React and Redux for state management. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The app fetches initial tasks from a dummy API (JSONPlaceholder) and provides CRUD functionality.

## Features
- **Add New Tasks**: Allows users to create new tasks.
- **Edit Tasks**: Users can update the title and description of existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks.
- **Mark as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed or pending.
- **Fetch Tasks**: The app fetches initial tasks from an external API (JSONPlaceholder).

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For managing the app's state.
- **React Router**: For navigating between different pages (Home, Add Task, Edit Task).
- **Axios**: To make API requests to JSONPlaceholder.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 14 or above)
